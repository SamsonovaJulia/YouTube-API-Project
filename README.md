# Introduction

Use Angular 1 or ReactJs to develop the following solution.

This exam will use the Youtube API to fetch data and embed it to a page.

# Description

One will allow the user to paste YouTube links which will be parsed and embed the correct YouTube video.

The second will perform a keyword search for a video via the YouTube API, will let the user select one, and embed (view) it.

We’ll treat YouTube as one of many possible “sources” which can either support pasting a link, or performing a search via an API.

Build the app in such a way to allow for maximum extensibility in adding new “sources”.

Try and support as many URL variation as you can.

URL parsing and search actions should be decoupled from one another as to support only one OR the other for different sources. e.g. support adding only link parsing for Instagram, but not search.
